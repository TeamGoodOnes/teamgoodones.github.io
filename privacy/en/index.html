<p>Your privacy is very important to us. GetSorted does therefor not collect or upload any of your media, such as
    images or videos, to our servers.</p>
<p>GetSorted is an app developed by Thomas Jirout in Vienna, Austria.
    The development and the usage data (more on this below) collected by this app will be analyzed and are an
    important contribution to a bachelor thesis on gamification at Vienna University of Technology.</p>
<h3 id="information-sorted-collects-and-how-it-is-used">Information GetSorted Collects and How it is used</h3>
<ul>
    <li>In order to provide our service, we maintain a local database on your device with information and
        metadata about your
        media, such as photos and images, so that GetSorted can remember things like which items you have already
        sorted or which months you have started sorting. This database exists only locally on your device and is
        not uploaded or synced with our servers.</li>
    <li>We use the external service Firebase to collect usage data. This helps us to learn how our users use our
        app and gives us insight on areas to improve. Such data may include, among other metrics, how frequently
        our users open the app, how much time they spend sorting, or how many photos they have in their photo
        library. Firebase creates a randomly generated Instance ID for every user using the app. This way,
        Firebase can bundle information it collects by user. This helps make the analysis more meaningful. More
        information on Instance IDs can be found on the Firebase website: <a
            href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/manage-iids" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/manage-iids</a>
        By using GetSorted, you therefor also consent to the Firebase privacy policy linked here: <a
            href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>
    </li>
    <li>The information collected through Firebase will further be analyzed, used and published for scientific
        purposes. I.e., GetSorted will use and analyze this usage information for a bachelor theses on gamification
        at Vienna University of Technology.</li>
